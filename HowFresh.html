					<p>According to the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), around 40 percent of the food in the United States is never eaten. The reasons for this may vary. However, the most prominent reason for this is because people forget they buy the food and do not keep track of their expiration date that they end up throwing them away. </p>
