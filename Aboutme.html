			<div id="statement">
				<p>I am a Chinese citizen. I was born and I grew up in China. I was pleased and proud to complete my undergraduate career at the Dalian University of Technology in Dalian, China. With a persistent dedication to academic learning, I secured the opportunity to participate in the  UCI exchange program, where I spend 3 years at Dalian University of Technology and the final years at the University of California Irvine. With this immensely valuable experience, I favorably had the unique opportunity to be part of a multicultural atmosphere and distinct teaching style, which I found particularly enlightening in many aspects. As of now, I am a Master of Science in Computer Science Student at Northwestern University. <br><br>In my free time, I enjoy traveling. I have been to many provinces in China. Also, I like photography. When I am traveling, I often post photos on WeChat to share the beautiful scenery with my friends.</p>
